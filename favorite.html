        <h1>Game of Thrones</h1>
        <p>Game of Thrones follows a large cast of characters and interwoven story arcs. It is primarily set on the fictional continent of Westeros, which is divided into the Seven Kingdoms and the lands in the far North beyond “the Wall,” an enormous wall of fortified ice.</p>
        <h2>Main characters</h2>
        <p>Ned Stark - The head of House Stark. Warden of the North. Father to the Stark children.</p>
        <p>Catelyn Stark - Wife of Ned Stark. Mother of the Stark children. A lady from House Tully of the Riverlands.</p>
        <p>Robert Baratheon - The King of Westeros. Ned Stark's friend.</p>
        <p>Cersei Lannister - The Queen of Westeros. Wife to Robert Baratheon. Daughter of the Lord of Casterly Rock, Tywin Lannister.</p>
        <p>Jaime Lannister - Twin brother of Cersei Lanister.</p>
        <p>Jon Snow - "Bastard son" of Lord Stark.</p>
        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>The main story occurs in the the continent of Westeros and Essos. Within Westeros resides the seven kingdoms.</p>
        <h3>Main Plot</h3>
        <p>The main plot of the show revolves around the political vying of noble houses throughout Westeros. It tackles the precedent events that lead to the war of the five kings following the beheading of Ned Stark. It shows how the main players form alliances and their betrayals, triumphs of our heroes, and the political warfare of the great houses.

        <H3>Themes</H3>
        <p>Both television critics and historians have praised the series for what was perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R. R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin said, "The true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval, which focuses on overlapping medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. In the series, political leaders have mostly been portrayed negatively, as they usually disregard the well-being of the common people and are guided in their decisions by selfish reasons. Few possible exceptions include Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister, who have shown concern about the populace. Still, their methods or commitment to the cause have been criticized. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. Unlike in many other fantasies, the series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective.

            In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed "plot armor" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14. A scientific study conducted in 2018 stated that about 60% of the major characters died as a result of violence and war.</p>
        <h3>My Personal Thoughts</h3>
        <p>I watched this series during the pandemic lockdown. Prior to that time, I was already a big fan of fantasy stories, but I mainly watch animated shows and read manga. This was the first time I watched fantasy that was not animated. Watching this show, I immediately loved how realistic it was. The politicking of the characters, the plot, the prophecy tropes, and the dialogue immersed me to their world. This show made me hate watching any other type of media for a long time, because of how amazing this story unfolded. It introduced me to western fantasy media and since then, I have been consuming shows and books that resemble this kind of storytelling and genre.</p>
